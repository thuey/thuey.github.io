If you're like me, then there are a lot of things about HTTP/2 that are still mysterious--things that are spoken about in whispers by the water cooler, but never witnessed in real life. One of these mythical beasts is known as Server Sent Events, or "SSE" as it is known amongst the indoctrinated. In this Knowledge Nugget, I hope to demystify SSE for myself and others.
